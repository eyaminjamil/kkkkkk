# README.md

## 1. What is README.md?

README.md is a Markdown file commonly used in software projects to provide information about the project. It serves as a documentation file that explains the purpose, features, installation instructions, and other relevant details about the project.

## 2. How to make a comment

To make a comment in Markdown, you can use the `<!-- -->` syntax. Anything written between these tags will be treated as a comment and will not be rendered in the final output.

## 3. Normal text & new line

To write normal text in Markdown, simply type your text. To create a new line, you can either add two spaces at the end of a line or use the `<br>` HTML tag.

## 4. Horizontal rule

To create a horizontal rule, you can use three or more hyphens (`---`), asterisks (`***`), or underscores (`___`) on a separate line.

## 5. Headings

To create headings in Markdown, you can use hash symbols (`#`). The number of hash symbols determines the level of the heading. For example:

# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3

## 6. Paragraph

To create a paragraph, simply write your text. Markdown automatically treats consecutive lines of text as separate paragraphs.

## 7. Italic

To italicize text, you can surround it with asterisks (`*`) or underscores (`_`). For example, `*italic*` or `_italic_`.

## 8. Bold

To make text bold, you can surround it with double asterisks (`**`) or double underscores (`__`). For example, `**bold**` or `__bold__`.

## 9. Strikethrough

To strikethrough text, you can use double tildes (`~~`). For example, `~~strikethrough~~`.

## 10. Inline code block

To create an inline code block, you can surround the code with backticks (``). For example, `` `code` ``.

## 11. Multiple line code block

To create a multiple-line code block, you can use triple backticks (```). You can also specify the programming language for syntax highlighting. For example:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
